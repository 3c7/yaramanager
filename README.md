# Yara Manager
A simple program to manage your yara ruleset in a database. By default sqlite will be used, but using MySQL/MariaDB or
Postgres is also possible.

## Todos
- [ ] Implement backup and sharing possibilities

## Installation
Install it using pip:
```shell
pip install yaramanager
```
Or grab one of the prebuilt binaries from the release page.

**If you want to use other databases than SQLite, you need to install the specific extra dependencies:**

```shell
pip install yaramanager[mysql]
pip install yaramanager[pgsql]
```

## Configuration
Yara Manager creates a fresh config if none exists. If you update from an older version, please pay attention to freshly
added [config options](resources/config.toml). You can reset you configuration using `ym config reset`, however, this
will also overwrite any custom changes you made.  

```toml
## Editor
# editor contains the command used to start the editor. Note that this must be a list of the command and the needed
# parameters, e.g. `editor = ["codium", "-w"]`.
editor = [ "codium", "-w" ]
```
The most important configuration to change is probably your editor. The default configuration uses `codium -w` for 
opening rules. You can use e.g. `EDITOR=vim DISABLE_STATUS=1 ym config edit` to open you config in Vim (and you can type
`:wq` to save your changes and quit :P). After changing the editor path, you are good to go! The following asciinema
shows how to quickly overwrite the editor set in the config:

[![Asciinema: Temporarily overwrite the used editor.](https://asciinema.org/a/auX5tjpeUiHCnsfCrO0MEPRY9.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/auX5tjpeUiHCnsfCrO0MEPRY9)

```toml
# Databases
# A list of databases. Every database needs to define a driver and a path, such as
#
# [[yaramanager.db.databases]]
# driver = "sqlite"
# path = "/home/user/.config/yaramanager/data.db"
[[yaramanager.db.databases]]
driver = "sqlite"
path = "/home/3c7/.config/yaramanager/myrules.db"
```
If you want to use multiple databases (which is pretty useful if you use rules from different sources or with different 
classifications), you can add them to the config file, too.

In order to use MySQL/MariaDB or Postgres, you need to specify the specific database driver, e.g.:

```toml
[[yaramanager.db.databases]]
driver = "mysql+pymysql"
path = "user:password@127.0.0.1/database"
[[yaramanager.db.databases]]
driver = "postgresql+psycopg2"
path = "user:password@127.0.0.1/database"
```
